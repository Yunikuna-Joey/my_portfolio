# Get started! 

1) Create your work-space and create a new folder 'project-name'
2) I'll be using Visual Studio Code, so in terminal, cd into the folder you just created 
3) Run the command 'npx create-react-app project-name' 

4) This will download the necessary packages and set up the necessary files for you 
5) Once the process is finished, make sure that you're in the 'project-name' directory 
6) Run the command 'npm start' 

7) You should be redirected to your browser and have a stock website loaded!
